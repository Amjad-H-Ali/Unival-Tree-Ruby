### Find Count of Single Valued Subtrees
###### Given a binary tree, write a program to count the number of Single Valued Subtrees. A Single Valued Subtree is one in which all the nodes have same value. Expected time complexity is O(n).


```
Input: root of below tree
              5
             / \
            1   5
           / \   \
          5   5   5
Output: 4
There are 4 subtrees with single values.

Output: 5
There are five subtrees with single values.
